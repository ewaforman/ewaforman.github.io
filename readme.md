My name is Ewa and I am aspiring software tester.
To achive my goal I have started learning Python. Then using Flask I created my first RESTful service offering all CRUD operations on a fully managed SQL database. I also prepared frontend application to communicate with my backend. Finallay I tested this with Selenium (Python). For gain some working experience I have recently started testing on the uTest platform.
